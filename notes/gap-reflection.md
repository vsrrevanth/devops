coding -

- I think I have come to this 15-20 times now and not consistent enough to pull this off.
- I love DSA and programming but never had that grit to complete the course or get used to solve LC persistently.
- I think I will be doing since I want to get in to a good devops role and it requires DSA too.

System Design

- Never directly studied or prepped for this. But as DevOps engg I think I know the basics of it since
  my work involves designing custom solutions to deliver the application to end users.
- That being said I'm really a rookie in this space
- Wanna get better by doing lumpsum casestudies and learning all the crucial topics to design the system
  well.
- I think I need practical learning for each of the concepts here which I can relate to real world problems.

Behavioral

- I am confident in talking and crafting a story, But I need practice for this.
- I need all the topics and wanna practice those with proper STAR stories to get the interview cracked.
